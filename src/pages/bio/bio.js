                            Passion is something that you love doing. It is liking

                            Before becoming a student of APC, Gualbertsan previously worked as a call center agent during the first half of 2017.
                            He was employed in a well-known company and was earning well. However, it was also during this time when he felt so
                            much dullness and dissatisfaction in his life. “I wasn’t given a chance to live with what I felt I deserved; I was stuck in
                            the monotony of routine, unable to extricate myself from that situation,” he said in an interview. Gualbertsan, being
                            creative at heart, took a bold step to pursue his artistic endeavors and decided to continue his education at APC to
                            specialize in filmmaking.

                                Since 2012, he has been certain about what he aspires to do
                                in life–that is to create films and become a great filmmaker.
                                The Filipino screenwriter and director, Raz Dela Torre,
                                played a huge influence on how he developed his dream.
                                For Gualbertsan, filmmaking is not just another profession.
                                He sees it as a form of self-expression, a medium for
                                communication, and simply as an enjoyable pursuit. Th
                                bizarreness of his surroundings fires up his imagination
                                and supplies him with excitement. He hankers to translat
                                these ideas and zeal into a form of art, particularly into
                                a film.

                                He is fond of creating short clips about what he feels.
                                He uses his own emotions in relaying the message that he
                                wants to tell. One of his works was about the sentiments
                                of a desperate man who was left all alone by the person
                                whom he needed the most – not his lover nor his mother,
                                but his thesis partner. It was a quirky and creative mimicry
                                of a typical student’s struggle and is relatable to those
                                who always carry the burdens of every group work. The
                                clip was posted on his Facebook account and has garnered
                                laughs and praises from people online.

                                stories of significance. One of his recent works, Kwaderno,
                                is a tale of an imaginative child who isn’t fortunate
                                enough to attend school yet strives to find a way to learn.

                                “I vent my feelings out through film and tell myself that everything will be alright,” he said. He finds peace and comfort

                            Apart from creating short clips as a way to express his
                            sentiments, he also directs films which aim to communicate
                            stories of significance. One of his recent works, Kwaderno,
                            is a tale of an imaginative child who isn’t fortunate
                            enough to attend school yet strives to find a way to learn.

                            The film advocates the right of every child to have access to education regardless of their social status. He wants his
                            films to inspire and inform viewers about the prevalent issues in society that are often being talked about. Last July 2019,
                            he was invited to showcase this film during the State of the Youth Address 2019 of the Southern Tagalog Youth Parliament.

                            He found his passion for weaving stories that are inspired by his circumstances, relationships, and the people around him.
                            “I vent my feelings out through film and tell myself that everything will be alright,” he said. He finds peace and comfort
                            whenever he expresses himself through his chosen craft. Truly, it is important to find an avenue to share and express oneself.
                            For Gualbertsan, he found his outlet through the art of filmmaking; in crafting stories, capturing people’s emotions, and
                            captivating the souls of his audience.

                            The story of this talented young man vividly reflects the values of courage and determination. Gualbertsan braved to
                            follow and continue his long-time dream and persevered to slowly build a name for himself. He was asked this question:
                            “What does it feel like to become a filmmaker?” He said, “It feels as if I can do whatever I want.” Following the trail of his passion
